# A responsive city skyline app

Practicing CSS variables by building a city skyline

This is a single-page responsive city skyline app built with HTML and CSS.
It can change between DAY and NIGHT depending on the size of the viewport.
Minimizing the viewport size changes the city skyline to NIGHT while maximizing the viewport size changes the city skyline to DAY.

I built this following freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design curriculum.
